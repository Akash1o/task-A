#TaskA



TaskA is an interactive web-based project that implements a dynamic, scrollable interface with a smooth transition effect. It features multiple items arranged in a stack, which can be navigated using a mouse wheel, touch gestures, or mouse click, allowing the user to scroll through the items.



#Known Limitations/Trade-offs



1. Performance on Mobile Devices:
Due to the use of CSS transitions and dynamic positioning, performance may be impacted on older or less powerful mobile devices.
2. Browser Compatibility:
The project has been tested on modern web browsers, but certain older browsers may have trouble with specific CSS3 features (such as transform and transition).
3. Limited Responsiveness:
While the design works on most screen sizes, there is no explicit media query to adjust the layout for smaller screens, which may cause issues on very small devices or screens.
4. Mouse Click Behavior:
The project is mainly optimized for touch and mouse wheel interactions, so mouse click functionality might not be as intuitive as scrolling.



#Future Improvements



1. Enhanced Responsiveness:
Implement media queries to ensure the project is fully responsive across all device sizes, including mobile and tablet devices.
2. Improved Touch Handling:
Add support for more advanced touch gestures, such as swiping or multi-touch.
3. Accessibility Enhancements:
Ensure that all interactions are accessible via keyboard (e.g., arrow keys, enter key) for users with disabilities.
4. Performance Optimization:
Optimize the JavaScript and CSS for better performance, especially on mobile devices with limited resources.
5. Customization Options:
Allow users to customize the appearance of the interface (e.g., change the gradient, adjust the number of items displayed, etc.).
